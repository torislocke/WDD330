						<h2>Summary Notes - Chapter Nine (9) The Window Object (14) HTML 5 API's</h2>

								<li>It is a bad idea from a usability standpoint to resize or move a user’s window.</li>

								<li>
									The Screen object has more uses for mobile devices. It also allows you to do things
									like turn off the device’s screen, detect a change in its orientation or lock it in
									a specific orientation.
								</li>
								<li>
									The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the
									screen, excluding any operating system menus:
								</li>
								<li>
									The use of document.write() is heavily frowned upon as it can only be realistically
									used by mixing JavaScript within an HTML document. There are still some extremely
									rare legitimate uses of it, but a ninja programmer will hardly ever need to use it.
								</li>
								<li>
									A restriction of cookies is that they can only be read by a web page from the same
									domain that set them. This is to stop sites being able to access information about
									users, such as other sites they have visited. Cookies are also limited to storing up
									to 4KB of data, although 20 cookies are allowed per domain, which can add up to
									quite a lot of data.
								</li>
								<li>
									Cookies use for data storage is starting to be replaced in many cases by the new
									HTML5 localStorage API as it allows more data to be stored. This is covered in
									Chapter 14. Cookies are still useful for retaining state information (such as if a
									user is logged in) because they’re passed between the client and server on every
									HTTP request.
								</li>
								<li>
									Adding the string ; secure to the end of a cookie will ensure it’s only transmitted
									over a secure HTTPS network:
								</li>

								<li>
									It’s still best practice to use feature detection before using any of the API
									methods.
								</li>
								<li>
									Web workers allow computationally complex operations to be performed in a separate
									thread, meaning that the flow of a program won’t suffer interruptions, and an
									application will not freeze or hang.
								</li>
								<li>
									Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also
									known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and responses are
									‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.
								</li>
								<li>
									There are some security and privacy considerations to keep in mind when considering
									some HTML5 APIs – especially those on the cutting edge that haven't been used 'in
									the wild' for long. For example, there are concerns that the ambient light API
									mightmake it possible to steal dataand the battery API has been dropped by Apple and
									Mozilla due to concerns overuser profiling.
