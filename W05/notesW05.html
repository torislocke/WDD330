						<h2>Summary Notes</h2>
						<div class="mainContent">
							<ul>
								<li><em>Remember to handle both touch and click events!</em></li>
								<li>
									Chapter 8: document.forms returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the DOM n
									order they appear, requires use of index notation or name attribute to return
									specific object/form.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 8: Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are
									easy to click and wipe out all the user data.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 8: input element objects have a "value" property that can be used to
									retrieve the information inside the field.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: Encapsulation, the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and
									only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user. In object orientated
									programming, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an obect and
									making methods available to implement the functionality.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: Polymorphism, various objects can share the same method, but also have
									the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: Inheritance, takes features of one object, inheriting all its properties
									and methods, then can improve on its functionality by adding new properties and
									methods.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: JavaScript ES6 supports classes, however it still uses this prototypal
									inheritance model in the background.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: the names of constructor functions or class declarations are
									capitalized, which is the convention used for classes in class-based programming
									languages (Ruby, Java).
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: ES6 class declarations are preferable to the constructor function
									syntas. They are more succinct, easier to read, and all code in a class definition
									is implicitly in strict mode.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: Any own properties will take precedence over the same prototype property
									when used in methods.
								</li>

								<li>
									Chapter 12: Golden Rule: Never use arrays or objects as a default value in
									prototype. Not a problem if arrays or objects are set as default values from within
									the constructor function in the class declaration.
								</li>
