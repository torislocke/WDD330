						<h2>Summary Notes</h2>
						<div class="mainContent">
							<ul>
								<li>
									Chapter 8: document.forms returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the DOM n
									order they appear, requires use of index notation or name attribute to return
									specific object/form.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 8: Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are
									easy to click and wipe out all the user data.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 8: input element objects have a "value" property that can be used to
									retrieve the information inside the field.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: Encapsulation, the inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and
									only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user. In object orientated
									programming, this involves keeping all the programming logic inside an obect and
									making methods available to implement the functionality.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: Polymorphism, various objects can share the same method, but also have
									the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: Inheritance, takes features of one object, inheriting all its properties
									and methods, then can improve on its functionality by adding new properties and
									methods.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: JavaScript ES6 supports classes, however it still uses this prototypal
									inheritance model in the background.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: the names of constructor functions or class declarations are
									capitalized, which is the convention used for classes in class-based programming
									languages (Ruby, Java).
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: ES6 class declarations are preferable to the constructor function
									syntas. They are more succinct, easier to read, and all code in a class definition
									is implicitly in strict mode.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: Any own properties will take precedence over the same prototype property
									when used in methods.
								</li>

								<li>
									Chapter 12: Golden Rule: Never use arrays or objects as a default value in
									prototype. Not a problem if arrays or objects are set as default values from within
									the constructor function in the class declaration.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 12: Avoid
									<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/pragmatic-monkey-patching/" target="_blank"
										>monkey-patching built-in objects.</a
									>
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 15: A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and
									methods that can be used in other files. Module code should have a single purpose,
									and group together functions with distinct functionality.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 15: It is good design to keep code as loosely coupled as possible as it
									allows for the most flexibility.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 15: All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use
									strict'.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 15: A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the
									top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.
								</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 15: The value of this in the top level of a module is undefined, rather than
									the global object.
								</li>
								<li>Chapter 15: You can't use HTML-style comments in modules.</li>
								<li>
									Chapter 15: ES6 module file uses the keyword export to specify any values or
									function that are to be made available from the module.
