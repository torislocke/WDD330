								<li>
									 Functions are first-class objects. They can have their own properties and methods, as well as accepting other functions as parameters and being returned by other functions. 
								</li>

								<li>
									ES6, the spread operator can be used to split an array of values into separate parameters.
								</li>
								<li>
									If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() method.  You need to provide null as its first argument.
								</li>
								<li>
                                    If a function takes some time to compute a return value, save the result in a cache property to improve users performance.
                                </li>
								<li>
                                    Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it’s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.
                                </li>
								<li>
									An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there’ll be no need for again. Because the code is only run once, there’s no need to create any reusable, named functions, and all the variables will also be temporary.
								</li>
								<li>
									Ajax: Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) solves the same-origin policy blocking all browsers issue to requests from a domain that is different from the page making the request.  CORS allows resources to be requested from another website outside the original domain.
