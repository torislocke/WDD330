							<ul>
								<li>
									Transform-origin property has the same syntax as the background-position property, and defaults to the center of the object (so that scales and rotations will be around the center of the box by default).
								</li>

								<li>
									Browser support for the transform-origin property is the same as for transform.  Prefixing is required when the transform property requires it.
								</li>
								<li>
									The order of transform functions matters: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis.
								</li>
								<li>
									CSS3 transforms are unsupported in IE before version 9, you can mimic these effects with other CSS properties, including filters. To mimic translation use position: relative; , and top and left values:.
								</li>
								<li>
									Native CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing than JavaScript, so they’ll usually appear smoother.
								</li>
								<li>
									The list of properties that can be animated is found athttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties.
								</li>
								<li>
									Canvas: If we don’t specify width and height , the canvas element will default to a
									width of 300 and a height of 150.
								</li>

								<li>Combining WebGL with HTML5 Canvas, you can draw in three dimensions.</li>
								<li>
									In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0,0). If the canvas is 200
									pixels by 200 pixels, then the bottom-right corner is (200,200).
								</li>
								<li>
									toDataURL creates a URL with the image in it, (either a png or jpg, whichever is
									specified). You can then right-click the image at this URL, and save it as a PNG or
									JPEG.
								</li>
