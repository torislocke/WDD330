						Object values can be modified.
					</li>
					<li>Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope.</li>

						Itâ€™s considered best practice to write each statement on a new line, terminated by a semi-colon;
					</li>
					<li>A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces: {}</li>

						TypeScriptis an open source superset of JavaScript that is maintained by Microsoft. It provides
						the option to specify the type of variables explicitly when they are declared, effectively
						making it a strongly typed version of JavaScript. It also adds some extra features and is
						designed to be make building large-scale applications easier in JavaScript. Programs are written
						in TypeScript and then transpiled into JavaScript.
					</li>
					<li>
						Strongly typed languages such as Java or Swift require the type of variables to be specified
						when they are declared. Trying to use the wrong data-type will cause an error.
					</li>
					<li>
						JavaScript is known as a weakly typed or loosely typed language. This means that you don't need
						to explicitly specify what data-type a variable is when you declare it. This can lead to
						unexpected behavior and hard to find bugs in code, particularly when type-coercion takes place
						in the background.
					</li>
					<li>
						When naming constants and variables, give them sensible names that describe what the variable
						represents
